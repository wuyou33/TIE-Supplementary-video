## RAMPAGE: Towards Whole-body, Real-Time and Agile Motion Planning in Dynamic Cluttered Environments for Mobile Manipulators
The supplementary materials are added at [Supplentary_Material_for_Rampage.pdf](Supplentary_Material_for_Rampage.pdf) to demonstrate that our solver can achieve SOTA performance in terms of solution speed and quality. Python codes for benchmarks are also available in this repository.

The supplementary video includes extensive experiment results and benchmark comparisons. Hope you to enjoy it. Thanks for watching!

### Several experimental results for the revised manuscript to demonstrate the real-time updated ESDF in dynamic environments 
### Simulated dynamic environment
The mobile manipulator perceives the obstacle pointcloud using on-robot lidar with 360 degree FOV. The video shows that both static and dynamic obstacles are well modelled in ESDF.

### Real-time perception and planning with only on-robot sensors in an unknown environment
In the pick-and-place experiment, the mobile manipulator perceives the obstacle using on-robot cameras and constructs the ESDF in real-time.
