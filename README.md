## RAMPAGE: Towards Whole-body, Real-Time and Agile Motion Planning in Dynamic Cluttered Environments for Mobile Manipulators
We proposed a framework for mobile manipulators to plan and execute wholebody trajectories in cluttered dynamic environments. Environmental maps are constructed in real time with only on-robot sensors. Extensive benchmark comparisons and experiment demonstrate that the proposed framework can plan and execute collision-free wholebody trajectory at an average speed of 1.86m/s among unknown dynamic obstacles with a maximum speed of 2m/s in simulation. Pick-and-place experimental results further verify our methodâ€™s effectiveness and efficiency in the real world.

### Several experimental results for the revised manuscript to demonstrate the real-time updated ESDF in dynamic environments 
### Simulated dynamic environment
The mobile manipulator perceives the obstacle pointcloud using on-robot lidar with 360 degree FOV. The video shows that both static and dynamic obstacles are well modelled in ESDF.
